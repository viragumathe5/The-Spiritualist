A stiff, smooth white note paper of the Albert size, i.e., about six inches in length, is cut into strips of one inch in breadth—any bookbinder will do this. 2. Place one of these strips in the tin-plate holder, which covers half an inch of each end. 3. Take a piece of camphor about the size of a bean, put it on a plate or other convenient place and ignite it. 4. Pass the paper in its holder several times rapidly over the top of the flame, not in the flame, as this would burn in the smoke and prevent the needle removing it easily. We thus get a strip of paper with five inches of its surface properly smoked and ready for use. 5. When the tracing has been made, write on the paper with something pointed, e.g., a toothpick, the patient’s name, his position ( | standing, — lying, / sit- ting), the pressure of the spring, the date, and any short note'you wish to make. Bemarks.—It is best to make these smoked papers at home, and to ca^ry them to the patient’s house in a small box provided for that purpose, and to replace them in the box when the tracing is made, in order to convey them home to be varnished. Directions for Varnishing the Smoked Papers. The best varnish for this purpose is that used by photo- graphers, called Crystal Varnish. A glass vessel about six inches high and 1J inch in diameter is filled with this varnish, and the smoked paper dipped into it for a second and then withdrawn. The varnished paper, smoked side uppermost, is then laid on a piece of blot- ting-paper. In two minutes it is perfectly dry, and ready for fixing in the case book. The instrument is manufactured by, and can now be obtained from Mr. John Ganter, of 19, Crawford Street, Montague Square, London. Except that the traces were thought to be large enough, there was no reason why Dr. Dudgeon’s sphygmographs should not have been made to magnify the pulse vibrations many more than fifty times; in fact, he has one in his possession which gives larger sphygmo- grams than usual. As sphygmography be- comes more studied, and critical questions arise as to the causes of small variations in the curves, no doubt larger instruments will come into use. Dr. Dudgeon’s instrument is defective in that it is too small for advanced students. Here and there the white line in the tracings is sometimes thickened by the smaller vibrations of the needle, the curves of these portions being lost instead of being saved by a larger sweep of the pointer, and a quicker motion of the paper. The first portion of the descending part of the curve, down to the aortic notch, is that which is alone of value in most of Dr. Purdon’s re- searches, and it would have been advantageous were this section given on a larger scale. Another easily remedied defect is, that after having put the instrument in its place, the present method of fastening the band tends to pull it from its true position, especially when the sphygmograph is used on the left wrist, where there is no resistance of the bone against the adverse pull due to the act of clamping. The following method of preparing the tracing papers has been devised and success- fully used for a long time by Staff Sergeant Fall: Station Hospital, Guernsey, March, 1882. Sir,—The apparatus designed by me for carbonising sphygmograph papers, consists of a wooden box, 22 inches long, 10 inches wide, and 8 inches deep, lined with tin on the bottom and sides, together with a perforated sheet of the same metal placed transversely in the centre. so :p S O ££ £3 _ The papers, which should be cut the required size, are slipped over studs permanently fixed to the sides of the top, thus forming a roof to the box, which at other times is left open together with the lower half of one end, which is kept for the introduction of an iron basin fixed to the end of aflat piece of iron sufficiently long to reach to the end of the box, and to which is affixed a wooden handle. A little wet sand or earth is then put in this vessel with about half an ounce of camphor in pieces placed here and there, so as to prevent melting into a mass and causing a large flame which would give much heat and little smoke. The vessel is then moved slowly backwards and forwards, by which means the smoke passes through the perforated tin, and deposits the car- bon on the paper. Twenty of these papers can be made at one time ; and of course more according to 1 he length of the box, with a proportional increase of camphor. About ten minutes is, as a rule, long enough to impart to the sphygmographic papers the necessary amount of darkness to enable the needle of the instrument to write sharply. If kept longer than this, the papers leave a thick deposit of carbon which is tilted off by the needle, thus spoiling the trace. The object in having a parti- tion of perforated tin in the centre of the box, is to prevent the papers from being burnt or scorched, in which case the needle passes over the paper without marking. After each time the apparatus is used it would be well to take a hand brush and sweep the sheet of tin, the holes of which soon become choked with soot, there- by causing much loss of time, and failure. If the papers are required to be made in large quanti- ties, a second box could be constructed with the roof and one end open for the first one to fit in, so that the smoke escaping from the first box, might be utilised for carbonising a second row of papers placed on the top of the second box, the upper end of which should be closed to prevent the exit of the smoke. It is necessary to add that on account of the exceeding blackness of the smoke arising during the use of this apparatus, it should not be used in a drawing-room, or in a place where works of art are kept. I would there- fore recommend those who wish to adopt the above plan of making sphygmographic papers, to do so in an empty room where free ventilation exists. The inhalation of carbon is not conducive to good health, as plainly mani- fested by the mortality caused by the late London fogs. I have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant, EDWARD FALL, Staff Sergeant and Compounder of Medicines, Army Hospital Corps. W. H. Harrison, Esq. {To be continued). T'hie Chrouxclje. MEDITJMSHIP IN INDIA. In the April No. of The Theosophisi (Bom- bay) Madame Blayatsky says about Mr. Eg- linton’s visit to India :—“We refused going to Calcutta to meet him, and felt obliged to deny ourselves and our numerous members” [of the Bombay Theosophical Society ?] “ the instructive pleasure of seeing him here, as was several times proposed. We have done so intentionally. Feeling that we had no right to subject him to insulting suspicions— such as we had ourselves to suffer from, and which once we were brought together would be sure to follow in our trail,—we abstained from seeing him, and spoke even of his work but casually once or twice in this journal, and only for the purpose of giving publicity to some wonderful phenomena of his ” ... “ we would never advise a professional medium, unless he is a coarse-fibred charlatan, to bring to India his ‘ angel guides.’ ” It is hard upon Anglo-Indians if they are to have no choice between witnessing psy- chical phenomena either through the powers of Madame Blavatsky or through coarse- fibred charlatans. This is riot the first time that individuals with psychical powers have done their best to enforce somewhat similar alternatives. It is an old story. Madame Blavatsky says :—“ Our cautious policy inspired by a natural feeling of deli- cacy—more for his sake than our own—was misunderstood nnd misinterpreted by our best friends.” A FEATURE OF MATERIALISM. A few evenings ago in one of his usual clear and sparkling Sunday evening addresses to the Marylebone Society of Spiritualists, at the Quebec Hall, 25, Great Quebec Street, Marylebone, Mr. Mac Donnell criticised Robert Ingersoll the American atheist, and his work. He commended his honesty and efficient action, but argued that the universal acceptance of his teachings would be de- structive to human happiness, and crushing to the hopes and aspirations of man. He however considered a certain amount of such work as Ingersoil’s to be good for the world, good for religion, good for Spiritualism at the present time. Men must clear the ground before they could build upon it efficiently, and persons like Ingersoll who pulled up rotten piles, destroyed shams and applied the 3? S IT O ZEE DE. 31 hammer to worthless images, were but clear- ing the ground which Spiritualism would afterwards quietly enter and occupy. Image breakers of Ingersoil’s class could not per- manently extirpate anything that was good. MESMERISM AT FOLKESTONE. A few evenings ago some mesmeric experi- ments were performed in the schoolrooms of the Congregational Chapel at Folkestone, by Mr. Turner, a working man, who differed from all other lecturers I have heard, by saying not a word from first to last, an ex- ample which might be imitated with ad- vantage in the House of Commons. Mr. Kerr did the speaking for him, and performed the first experiment by mesmerising\"\"\"\n",

      "Despite these setbacks, Dr. Dee continued his spiritual pursuits with unwavering faith in the messages he received.

      "Dr. Dee's unwavering belief in the spirits and his reliance on Kelley's mediumship ultimately led to a life filled with challenges and controversies.

JOHN DEE, who is popularly knowh as the great astrologer of the time of Queen Elizabeth, was born in London in 1527, and soon gained fame as a mathemati- cian and philosopher. On the founding of Trinity College, Cambridge, he was chosen as one of its fellows, and afterwards went to Louvain, where he took his doctor’s degree in civil law. In 1551 he returned to England as rector of Upton-upon-Severn. He was accused of preaching against the life of Queen Mary, for which he suffered imprisonment, but after her death he rose in favour with her successor, Elizabeth. During many years before his imprisonment he studied psychological phenomena as privately as possible, but was often in danger in consequence of rumours that he practised magical incantations; but about the year 1582, when he first discovered the mediumship of his assistant, Edward Kelley, he grew less reserved in making known the results of his experiences. There is in the British Museum library a book, published in London by the Rev. Meric Casaubon, D.D., entitled A True and Faithful Relation of what ^passed for some years between Dr. John Dee and some Spirits. The book, which is a large one, of about 500 pages, was, according to the title-page, “ Printed by D. Maxwell for T. Garthwait, and sold at the little north door of St. Paul’s and by other stationers, 1659.” Dr. Dee died in 1608, con- sequently the book just mentioned was published about fifty years after he departed this life. In publishing the book Dr. Casaubon was under the necessity of introducing it with a preface, setting forth the possibility, probability, nay, the reality of inter- course with spirits, hence this preface contains many arguments to the same effect as those in modern spi- ritual periodicals. He tells how convincing the facts are to atheists and materialists, but at the same time protects himself from the vengeance of the clergy of his day, by stating that Dr. Dee’s spirits must have been bad spirits—devils. The book itself consists entirely of records of seances, made by Dr. Dee himself at the time the facts came under his observation, and any Spiritualist can see at once that it is as accurate and reliable a diary as any man could write, although Dr. Dee was wofully mistaken in many of his ideas and conclusions. From the records of these seances—Dr. Dee calls them “ actions ”—it is clear that his assistant Kelley was a physical medium, also a seer; he could see spirits in crystals, he was clairaudiant; on some few occasions he obtained direct spirit-writing, also the direct spirit voice, and the movement of solid objects. He was a passionate, sensual, and not very intelligent individual; whilst Dr. Dee gradually became an enthusiast, Who believed all the spirits told him, and was entirely ruled by them in his actions. Dr. Dee believed that his magic crystal contained some latent virtue, for, know- ing nothing of mesmerism, he did not think that it merely served to draw the attention of the sensitive from surrounding objects. He did not know that the spirits most frequently in company with a medium are strongly allied to the medium in moral nature, nor did he know of the difficulty spirits have in signalling proper names through the organism of certain descrip- tions of mediums. Hence, through Kelley’s medium- ship, he believed himself to be in communion with Michael, Gabriel, and other real or fabulous persons. Edward Kelley was educated at Oxford, but did not pass his examination. While rambling about the coun- try both his ears were cut off at Lancaster for some offence, after which he became assistant to Dr. Dee, who discovered his remarkable clairvoyant powers. Kelley gave Dr. Dee much trouble; they frequently quarrelled, and the messages which Dr. Dee received with sacred awe, Kelley often treated with the utmost irreverence. At nearly all their seances the crystal was called into use, and in it Kelley saw the various spirits who spoke to him. Kelley’s general opinion of the apparitions was, says the chronicler, “ that they were meer illusions of the Divel and evil spirits,” and Dr. Dee, “ sometimes with much adoe, perswaded him to think better of them.” Dr. Dee offered to “pawn his soul” unto Kelley that they were good spirits sent from God as a mark of special favour. Kelley was not satisfied, and insisted that Dr. Dee should write his opinion of them in his book; and there it stands to the present day. Although Kelley was ignorant, some messages of high intelligence were occasionally given through him, also some in Greek and other languages which he did not Understand, and he grumbled at being forced to utter “ such gybberysh.” Kelley soon grew tired of the seances, and he cared nothing for the revelations; he was on the point of deserting Dr. Dee altogether, when the latter offered him ^650 a year to remain with him as a “ skyrer,” which was the Elizabethan term for “ medium.” A little experience taught Dr. Dee that spirits could sometimes say what was not true; this astonished him very much; still, he maintained that the majority of the spirits were good ones. The historian Casaubon was JULY 15, 1873. THE SPIRITUALIST. 259 perplexed by the evidence, and he asks how, if they wete evil, lying spirits, they could give such good mes- sages about piety and godliness ? He also says that the “Divel,” being the prince of this world, how was it hd did not give his servants Dee and Kelley money, tvhen they wanted it ? Dr. Dee, being interested, him- self questioned the spirits on this point, and they, told him “ it was not their mission, and was out of their power.” It was about the month of February, 1582, that Kelley first saw spirits in the crystal, which was “ a stone in which and out of which persons who are qualified for it, and admitted to the sight of it, the shapes and figures mentioned in every action [seance] were Seen.” When Kelley was ill or absent, Dr. Dee’s son Arthur, or a youth named Bartholomew, who both' had some slight medial powers, took Kelley’s place. Soon after they began their seances, Dr. Dee and Kelley tried very hard to please Albert Lasky, one of the Princes Palatine of Poland, who wished the spirits to aid him in ambitious political intrigues ; he Was often pre- sent at the seances, so also were Mrs. Kelley and Mrs. Dee. The spirits made the whole party the most glorious promises, just as they did to Mr. Crookes when he first began to investigate Spiritualism. Among other things, they promised to find the philosopher’s stone for Dr. .Dee, at which he was greatly elated. Just _at the time, when kingdoms were to be over- thrown, and the philosopher’s stone produced by spirits, the mouthpiece of the angels, Mr. Kelley, grew more in- tractable. Row and then he was intoxicated, and Dr. Dee complained that he could not rely on the truthful- ness of Kelley’s account of any <f action” at which he, Dr. Dee, was not also present. Kelley frequently advised Dr. Dee to give up Spiritualism, or “ it would ruin himand as for the Spiritual promises, he said, “ Yet, I am Thomas Didymus, and will believe these things when I see the fruits of them.” Sometimes he would enter the house in a passion about gossip respect- ing what people had been saying of him, and not at all in a fit state of mind for a seance. On one of these occasions, while summing up his grievances to Dr. Dee, he said, “ I cannot abide my wife; I love her not— nay, I abhor her.” This remark shows the state of his mind, and tends to account for some few messages of a directly evil nature which the members of the circle received. One of the spirits most frequently with him was a lively girl named, not “ Katie,” but “ Madini,” who at one seance said, “ Curst wives and great devils are sore companions”—a remark, it will be noticed, full of the thoughts of the medium. At one seance he asked Madini “to lend him £100 for a fortnight;” in fact, his leading thoughts were earthly and sublunary, and Dr. Dee states Kelley’s greatest fear was that of poverty. On Thursday, April 19th, 1584, Kelley again told Dr. Dee that he would have no more seances, for the spirits must be all deluders “ who had not in two years’ space made them able to understand or do somewhat,” so thenceforth he, Dr. Dee, must use his boy John as a “ skyrer,” With some difficulty Dr. Dee pacified him, whilst Michael and Gabriel rebuked the unfortunate medium for calling them “devils,” and censured Dr. Dee for want of faith. About this time, indeed, Dr. Dee’s faith and enthusiasm were a little shaken. He had been promised the philosopher’s stone by the spirits, and in his turn had promised it to the Emperor Bodol- phus II. of Germany, but the spirits had not produced it, so Dr. Dee was certainly placed in an awkward posi- tion. Again, the spirits had told him (while in Prague with Kelley for the purpose of visiting the Emperor) some distinct and specific lies; among others was one, that Sir Henry Sydney died on the 18th February, 1584, whereas he was alive. So Dr. Dee questioned them very closely on these clear points. In reply to his questions they made long harangues, and finally satisfied him that it was all right, as spirit messages must be interpreted with care. Dr. Casaubon calls these recorded harangues “ sermon-like stuff.” While waiting at Prague to see the Emperor, Dr. Dee was a guest in the house of Dr.Hageck, where Kelley gave him more trouble. He was called down one morning to look at his assistant—the mouthpiece of Michael and all angels—who was lying snoring on a form, on which he had spent the night, having come home in a state of intoxication with Alexander, the servant of Prince Lasky. Alexander was also not sober, and in a furious passion, because Kelley threatened to cut off his head with a walking-stick. They had a violent quarrel in Dr. Dee’s presence, and he had some difficulty in separating them. At last Dr. Dee had an hour’s interview with the Emperor Kodolphus, whom he had previously well deluged with the letters and tracts about the power of spirits, and the production of the philosopher’s stone. Bodolphus returned him his book Monas, saying that it was “ too hard for his capacity to understand,” which is just what the president of the spiritual meetings in Harley-street recently remarked about an exceedingly mystical paper read there. During the interview Dr. Dee apparently did all the talking, telling how he held constant conversations with the angels of the Lord, the Emperor at the close making a few courteous remarks in so low a tone that Dr. Dee heard them imperfectly. From that time forth the Emperor took no notice of Dr. Dee or his letters, but when Dr. Dee, tired of wait- ing, applied for a passport to return home, it was fur- nished without a moment’s delay. While thus dancing attendance upon royalty in Prague, Dr. Dee and his wife were reduced to extreme penury, and Kelley was constantly threatening to leave them to return home. Prince Lasky often aided Dr. Dee at such times. While at Prague Dr. Dee, who had always previously been looked upon as an honourable and learned man,, was considered by most to be a char- latan trying to get money from the Emperor, and by others he was charitably thought to be a visionary. One nobleman delicately hinted to him, in a friendly way, that his tales about spirits were so improbable that he could not expect anybody to believe them. There is no doubt that Dr. Dee’s actions were impru- dent, and that he was guided by blind faith instead of common sense. To make matters worse, he heard in Prague that Queen Elizabeth was angry at his long absence, and that the Bishop of London intended to charge him with necromancy on his return home. Next they visited the court of Stephen, King of Poland, who, after raising a few theological objections, attended one of their seances\"\"\"\n",

A stiff, smooth white note paper of the Albert size, i.e., about six inches in length, is cut into strips of one inch in breadth—any bookbinder will do this. 2. Place one of these strips in the tin-plate holder, which covers half an inch of each end. 3. Take a piece of camphor about the size of a bean, put it on a plate or other convenient place and ignite it. 4. Pass the paper in its holder several times rapidly over the top of the flame, not in the flame, as this would burn in the smoke and prevent the needle removing it easily. We thus get a strip of paper with five inches of its surface properly smoked and ready for use. 5. When the tracing has been made, write on the paper with something pointed, e.g., a toothpick, the patient’s name, his position ( | standing, — lying, / sit- ting), the pressure of the spring, the date, and any short note'you wish to make. Bemarks.—It is best to make these smoked papers at home, and to ca^ry them to the patient’s house in a small box provided for that purpose, and to replace them in the box when the tracing is made, in order to convey them home to be varnished. Directions for Varnishing the Smoked Papers. The best varnish for this purpose is that used by photo- graphers, called Crystal Varnish. A glass vessel about six inches high and 1J inch in diameter is filled with this varnish, and the smoked paper dipped into it for a second and then withdrawn. The varnished paper, smoked side uppermost, is then laid on a piece of blot- ting-paper. In two minutes it is perfectly dry, and ready for fixing in the case book. The instrument is manufactured by, and can now be obtained from Mr. John Ganter, of 19, Crawford Street, Montague Square, London. Except that the traces were thought to be large enough, there was no reason why Dr. Dudgeon’s sphygmographs should not have been made to magnify the pulse vibrations many more than fifty times; in fact, he has one in his possession which gives larger sphygmo- grams than usual. As sphygmography be- comes more studied, and critical questions arise as to the causes of small variations in the curves, no doubt larger instruments will come into use. Dr. Dudgeon’s instrument is defective in that it is too small for advanced students. Here and there the white line in the tracings is sometimes thickened by the smaller vibrations of the needle, the curves of these portions being lost instead of being saved by a larger sweep of the pointer, and a quicker motion of the paper. The first portion of the descending part of the curve, down to the aortic notch, is that which is alone of value in most of Dr. Purdon’s re- searches, and it would have been advantageous were this section given on a larger scale. Another easily remedied defect is, that after having put the instrument in its place, the present method of fastening the band tends to pull it from its true position, especially when the sphygmograph is used on the left wrist, where there is no resistance of the bone against the adverse pull due to the act of clamping. The following method of preparing the tracing papers has been devised and success- fully used for a long time by Staff Sergeant Fall: Station Hospital, Guernsey, March, 1882. Sir,—The apparatus designed by me for carbonising sphygmograph papers, consists of a wooden box, 22 inches long, 10 inches wide, and 8 inches deep, lined with tin on the bottom and sides, together with a perforated sheet of the same metal placed transversely in the centre. so :p S O ££ £3 _ The papers, which should be cut the required size, are slipped over studs permanently fixed to the sides of the top, thus forming a roof to the box, which at other times is left open together with the lower half of one end, which is kept for the introduction of an iron basin fixed to the end of aflat piece of iron sufficiently long to reach to the end of the box, and to which is affixed a wooden handle. A little wet sand or earth is then put in this vessel with about half an ounce of camphor in pieces placed here and there, so as to prevent melting into a mass and causing a large flame which would give much heat and little smoke. The vessel is then moved slowly backwards and forwards, by which means the smoke passes through the perforated tin, and deposits the car- bon on the paper. Twenty of these papers can be made at one time ; and of course more according to 1 he length of the box, with a proportional increase of camphor. About ten minutes is, as a rule, long enough to impart to the sphygmographic papers the necessary amount of darkness to enable the needle of the instrument to write sharply. If kept longer than this, the papers leave a thick deposit of carbon which is tilted off by the needle, thus spoiling the trace. The object in having a parti- tion of perforated tin in the centre of the box, is to prevent the papers from being burnt or scorched, in which case the needle passes over the paper without marking. After each time the apparatus is used it would be well to take a hand brush and sweep the sheet of tin, the holes of which soon become choked with soot, there- by causing much loss of time, and failure. If the papers are required to be made in large quanti- ties, a second box could be constructed with the roof and one end open for the first one to fit in, so that the smoke escaping from the first box, might be utilised for carbonising a second row of papers placed on the top of the second box, the upper end of which should be closed to prevent the exit of the smoke. It is necessary to add that on account of the exceeding blackness of the smoke arising during the use of this apparatus, it should not be used in a drawing-room, or in a place where works of art are kept. I would there- fore recommend those who wish to adopt the above plan of making sphygmographic papers, to do so in an empty room where free ventilation exists. The inhalation of carbon is not conducive to good health, as plainly mani- fested by the mortality caused by the late London fogs. I have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant, EDWARD FALL, Staff Sergeant and Compounder of Medicines, Army Hospital Corps. W. H. Harrison, Esq. {To be continued).\"\n",

A stiff, smooth white note paper of the Albert size, i.e., about six inches in length, is cut into strips of one inch in breadth—any bookbinder will do this. 2. Place one of these strips in the tin-plate holder, which covers half an inch of each end. 3. Take a piece of camphor about the size of a bean, put it on a plate or other convenient place and ignite it. 4. Pass the paper in its holder several times rapidly over the top of the flame, not in the flame, as this would burn in the smoke and prevent the needle removing it easily. We thus get a strip of paper with five inches of its surface properly smoked and ready for use. 5. When the tracing has been made, write on the paper with something pointed, e.g., a toothpick, the patient’s name, his position ( | standing, — lying, / sit- ting), the pressure of the spring, the date, and any short note'you wish to make. Bemarks.—It is best to make these smoked papers at home, and to ca^ry them to the patient’s house in a small box provided for that purpose, and to replace them in the box when the tracing is made, in order to convey them home to be varnished. Directions for Varnishing the Smoked Papers. The best varnish for this purpose is that used by photo- graphers, called Crystal Varnish. A glass vessel about six inches high and 1J inch in diameter is filled with this varnish, and the smoked paper dipped into it for a second and then withdrawn. The varnished paper, smoked side uppermost, is then laid on a piece of blot- ting-paper. In two minutes it is perfectly dry, and ready for fixing in the case book. The instrument is manufactured by, and can now be obtained from Mr. John Ganter, of 19, Crawford Street, Montague Square, London. Except that the traces were thought to be large enough, there was no reason why Dr. Dudgeon’s sphygmographs should not have been made to magnify the pulse vibrations many more than fifty times; in fact, he has one in his possession which gives larger sphygmo- grams than usual. As sphygmography be- comes more studied, and critical questions arise as to the causes of small variations in the curves, no doubt larger instruments will come into use. Dr. Dudgeon’s instrument is defective in that it is too small for advanced students. Here and there the white line in the tracings is sometimes thickened by the smaller vibrations of the needle, the curves of these portions being lost instead of being saved by a larger sweep of the pointer, and a quicker motion of the paper. The first portion of the descending part of the curve, down to the aortic notch, is that which is alone of value in most of Dr. Purdon’s re- searches, and it would have been advantageous were this section given on a larger scale. Another easily remedied defect is, that after having put the instrument in its place, the present method of fastening the band tends to pull it from its true position, especially when the sphygmograph is used on the left wrist, where there is no resistance of the bone against the adverse pull due to the act of clamping. The following method of preparing the tracing papers has been devised and success- fully used for a long time by Staff Sergeant Fall: Station Hospital, Guernsey, March, 1882. Sir,—The apparatus designed by me for carbonising sphygmograph papers, consists of a wooden box, 22 inches long, 10 inches wide, and 8 inches deep, lined with tin on the bottom and sides, together with a perforated sheet of the same metal placed transversely in the centre. so :p S O ££ £3 _ The papers, which should be cut the required size, are slipped over studs permanently fixed to the sides of the top, thus forming a roof to the box, which at other times is left open together with the lower half of one end, which is kept for the introduction of an iron basin fixed to the end of aflat piece of iron sufficiently long to reach to the end of the box, and to which is affixed a wooden handle. A little wet sand or earth is then put in this vessel with about half an ounce of camphor in pieces placed here and there, so as to prevent melting into a mass and causing a large flame which would give much heat and little smoke. The vessel is then moved slowly backwards and forwards, by which means the smoke passes through the perforated tin, and deposits the car- bon on the paper. Twenty of these papers can be made at one time ; and of course more according to 1 he length of the box, with a proportional increase of camphor. About ten minutes is, as a rule, long enough to impart to the sphygmographic papers the necessary amount of darkness to enable the needle of the instrument to write sharply. If kept longer than this, the papers leave a thick deposit of carbon which is tilted off by the needle, thus spoiling the trace. The object in having a parti- tion of perforated tin in the centre of the box, is to prevent the papers from being burnt or scorched, in which case the needle passes over the paper without marking. After each time the apparatus is used it would be well to take a hand brush and sweep the sheet of tin, the holes of which soon become choked with soot, there- by causing much loss of time, and failure. If the papers are required to be made in large quanti- ties, a second box could be constructed with the roof and one end open for the first one to fit in, so that the smoke escaping from the first box, might be utilised for carbonising a second row of papers placed on the top of the second box, the upper end of which should be closed to prevent the exit of the smoke. It is necessary to add that on account of the exceeding blackness of the smoke arising during the use of this apparatus, it should not be used in a drawing-room, or in a place where works of art are kept. I would there- fore recommend those who wish to adopt the above plan of making sphygmographic papers, to do so in an empty room where free ventilation exists. The inhalation of carbon is not conducive to good health, as plainly mani- fested by the mortality caused by the late London fogs. I have the honor to be, Sir, your obedient servant, EDWARD FALL, Staff Sergeant and Compounder of Medicines, Army Hospital Corps. W. H. Harrison, Esq. {To be continued). T'hie Chrouxclje. MEDITJMSHIP IN INDIA. In the April No. of The Theosophisi (Bom- bay) Madame Blayatsky says about Mr. Eg- linton’s visit to India :—“We refused going to Calcutta to meet him, and felt obliged to deny ourselves and our numerous members” [of the Bombay Theosophical Society ?] “ the instructive pleasure of seeing him here, as was several times proposed. We have done so intentionally. Feeling that we had no right to subject him to insulting suspicions— such as we had ourselves to suffer from, and which once we were brought together would be sure to follow in our trail,—we abstained from seeing him, and spoke even of his work but casually once or twice in this journal, and only for the purpose of giving publicity to some wonderful phenomena of his ” ... “ we would never advise a professional medium, unless he is a coarse-fibred charlatan, to bring to India his ‘ angel guides.’ ” It is hard upon Anglo-Indians if they are to have no choice between witnessing psy- chical phenomena either through the powers of Madame Blavatsky or through coarse- fibred charlatans. This is riot the first time that individuals with psychical powers have done their best to enforce somewhat similar alternatives. It is an old story. Madame Blavatsky says :—“ Our cautious policy inspired by a natural feeling of deli- cacy—more for his sake than our own—was misunderstood nnd misinterpreted by our best friends.” A FEATURE OF MATERIALISM. A few evenings ago in one of his usual clear and sparkling Sunday evening addresses to the Marylebone Society of Spiritualists, at the Quebec Hall, 25, Great Quebec Street, Marylebone, Mr. Mac Donnell criticised Robert Ingersoll the American atheist, and his work. He commended his honesty and efficient action, but argued that the universal acceptance of his teachings would be de- structive to human happiness, and crushing to the hopes and aspirations of man. He however considered a certain amount of such work as Ingersoil’s to be good for the world, good for religion, good for Spiritualism at the present time. Men must clear the ground before they could build upon it efficiently, and persons like Ingersoll who pulled up rotten piles, destroyed shams and applied the 3? S IT O ZEE DE. 31 hammer to worthless images, were but clear- ing the ground which Spiritualism would afterwards quietly enter and occupy. Image breakers of Ingersoil’s class could not per- manently extirpate anything that was good. MESMERISM AT FOLKESTONE. A few evenings ago some mesmeric experi- ments were performed in the schoolrooms of the Congregational Chapel at Folkestone, by Mr. Turner, a working man, who differed from all other lecturers I have heard, by saying not a word from first to last, an ex- ample which might be imitated with ad- vantage in the House of Commons. Mr. Kerr did the speaking for him, and performed the first experiment by mesmerising\"\"\"\n",

V ERY into soon after the introduction of Modern Spiritualism England the subject attracted attention in jClerkenwell and neighbourhood, where several circles were formed, some of which were continued for a long number of years, and the great and increasing pressure from strangers for admission thereto led, in May, 1869, to the formation of this Assocciation. ,It seeks as its main object to assist, by various means, any person desirous to obtain information respecting Spiritualism, or to commence the investiga- tion of its facts; but, whilst Members unite for this purpose, they have opportunities of improving their own knowledge of its teachings and varied phenomena, of becoming acquainted with the experience and opinions of others, and with the general literature of the movement. Free public Services are held on Sunday evenings at Goswell Hall, 86, Goswell-road, and other meetings (of which announcement is duly made) are held on Thursday evenings'; the latter meetings consist of seances, con- ferences, narrations of experience, the reading of papers, &c. Strangers are admitted on Thursday evenings on the introduction of a Member. Social gatherings are ocasionally held for bringing Members and friends nto closer acquaintance with one another.\"\"\"\n",

SOME very interesting spirit - communications from Swedenborg and Lord Bacon were received in the course of the years 1853 and 1854, at Judge Edmonds’ circle'in New York. These communications were after- wards published in a work on Spiritualism, in two volumes, by Judge Edmonds, Mr. G-. T. Dexter, M.D., and the -Governor of Wisconsin. The messages de- scribed much of the life and habits of the spirits in the condition of life incidental to the two spirits who com- municated, and the opening greetings of the spirits every evening before the real work began were of a very pleasing nature. On the evening of May 1, 1853, Swedenborg said:— “■ With feelings of affection and love to you all, and with my spirit gushing forth with joy for the opportu- nities I enjoy in communicating with you, I again most sincerely greet you in God’s most holy name.” On April 24, 1853, he said :— “ In our circle, where 'the spirits of those we love most do congregate, are gathered together once more, weekly, this number, and we celebrate what to us is the Sabbath-day. It is indeed a beautiful thought to you, dear friends, that we live and act almost as you do, that we cherish a thousand associations which on earth were most dear. With all my feelings alive to the affectionate remembrances of life with my friends, and eternity with my spirit companions too, I this night greet you cordially, heartily, and truthfully, in the name of our heavenly Father.” On May 8, 1853, he said:— “ The night is dark and stormy, and the air should be chill and uncomfortable. You draw near your fire- sides and sit conversing with one another, and opening your hearts to the genial influence of social connections. With us, we do not feel the effects of storm or cold when approaching your earth, and our spirits are not clothed ■ with such garments as hide the true purposes of our hearts. We converse with one another, but our mean- ing is perceived without the expression of thought; and the farther we progress the more is our spirit manifest through all the developments of its covering. But to- night, in spite of rain and chill, I meet warm hearts and strong desires to excel, and I give you a response founded on the very basis of our creation—a response of love and truth, and greet you in the name of God.” On May 19, 1853, he said:— “ There are to-night with me many spirits of your friends, who have met accidentally, but who delegate me to say that their affection surrounds you, and their love is a part of your existence, as through it you may receive many impressions for good, and by it you are supported to endure many of the troubles and ills of life. Cordially, heartily, and affectionately they, with me, greet you to-night.” On May 22, 1853, he said :— “ While we are listening to thoughts from the spirit- land, and wonder at the developments made of what have been mysteries, have we, when our hearts have been filled with joy at the description of the beautiful abodes of the just, and the happiness diffused like air through all the higher spheres of the spirits’ dwelling- place, have we ever asked ourselves the question, for what purpose are these teachings ? Why have spirits left their homes, their pursuits, their affections, their upward flight towards the ultimate point of their exist- ence ? Why have they come to us, and why have they taught us the higher truths of spirit-revelation ? Why have they selected us as the recipients of spirit-bounty ? “ Is it not that your own natures should be made to correspond with the pure and holy existences of those good spirits whose habits, life, and progress we have de- scribed ? Is it-not that you should struggle to elevate n-^wir own internal natures, and divest yourselves of those characteristics which mark you as still bound in the fetters of error ? > “ How hard have you struggled ? How much have • you succeeded? And how long will it be before.you shall have cast off all that cloaks your true feelings, and manifest the true condition and action of your life ? How long will you battle with causes which you suffer to influence you, and not purge yourselves of all un- righteousness ? “ These are grave and important inquiries, which should be put to every heart, and earnestly too, sincerely too, in the spirit of truth, of love, and of strong desire to answer truly the responses of our own hearts, before our friends who know and the God who made us. “ In a spirit, to-night, of affection that brings you near my soul, and with a love that brings me to you for the high object of doing you good, do I greet you in the name of God.” On June 16, 1853, Swedenborg said:— “ My friends, could you but know the great joy there is among us, could you see the unspeakable happiness which animates every countenance at the spread of the glorious truths which are being revealed to man, and could you know the deep earnest faith we have in those selected to give to the world the first revelations of the higher spirits to man, you would then realise the emo- tions of spirit in the spheres, the emotion of unmixed love , . at the dawning of truth. Our blessings with each and all.” (General THE 'SPIBITUALIST.—The first number of this Journal has to meet a demand which at the present time is to large extent unknown, but it is believed that a supply considerably in excess of the probable sale, has been printed. At the same time, as new journals of this kind, connected with a growing movement, often run out of print before the demand ceases, subscribers who wish to preserve copies for binding, had either better keep those they receive in the first instance, or let orders for additional copies reach the publisher by Wednesday next. Up to that day this number will be still in type, so that more copies can be printed if they are likely to be wanted. Stiff covers, with elastic strings at the back, to hold for reference many copies of THE SPIRITUALIST, and to keep them clean till required for binding, may be obtained of Mr. H. K. Judd, bookbinder, 15, Little New-street, Earring- don-street, E.C., at various prices. THE DIALECTICAL SOCIETT.—A summary of the past pro- ceedings of the Dialectical Society is printed on another page, and their future meetings will be regularly reported in this journal. The evidence already given necessarily relates mostly to physical manifestations, since these, when proved to be facts, are beyond the reach of fancy, and cannot be con- sidered as obscure psychological phenomena incidental to human beings in an abnormal state. Still, non-Spiritualists should understand that physical phenomena at circles are usually followed, or accompanied, by spirit communications. After the production in our presence of some of the wonderful phenomena incidental to Mr. Home’s mediumship, the spirits once gave an address to the effect that they only gave the manifestations to demonstrate that a real, practical, and intel- ligent power was at work. These high-class spirits disclaimed the possession of miraculous powers, and said that they were able to produce the effects simply because they have learnt more of the laws of Nature than we have. Sometimes they fail when they attempt to give manifestations. THE GOWER-STEEET CONFERENCE.\"\"\"\n",
